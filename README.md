[ About ]

This GSC Injector's source code is based on the GSC Injection process from Project Donetsk.
I would like to express my utmost respect and gratitude to Mr. Sku-111 for devising and implementing this injection process.
Thank you always, and I support you.

----------

[ Caution ]

Regarding the GSC compiler and decompiler functions, many of the instructions are incorrect because we have not analyzed all of the hash tokens.
Since I play Vanguard at Retail, I don't intend to make many modifications to the gsc-tool for the Beta build.
If you want to seriously create GSC for the Beta build, please modify the gsc-tool's hash tokens on your own.

----------

[ Implemented ]

The following items are currently completed:

- dll Injector
- GSC Injector
- GSC Dumper
- GSCBIN Dump Data

----------

[ Custom GSC ( gsc-tool ) ]

Currently, the following GSC functions and tokens can be used.
All other commands are almost always incorrect and may cause a crash.
