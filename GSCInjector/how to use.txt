Place this "VG_BETA_GSC_CUSTOM" folder in the Documents folder on your PC.
Then, run "CoDV_dll_Face_Injector.exe" as an administrator.

Since this Face Injector operates at the kernel level, it may be flagged as a virus. Before running the app, disable the Windows antivirus system in advance.

After launching the app, once the driver is initialized, start Call of Duty Vanguard Public Beta.
Once the game is launched, the Face Injector will recognize Vanguard and automatically begin the GSC Injection process.

Note that this Face Injector uses a driver pattern that is detected in the retail version of Call of Duty.
After using GSC in the Vanguard Beta, if you plan to launch other games, restart your PC beforehand.
Shutting down the PC or unplugging the power cord will prevent the driver from initializing properly, increasing the risk of a ban.
Be sure to carefully restart your PC to avoid this.
